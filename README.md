# <nlw/> - SETUP

Online and free programming event in practice with lots of code, challenges and networking. Using technologies: React and React Native, Node.js, TypeScript, Expo and Tailwind

The project that we are going to create in just 5 classes has everything to do with the start of a new year: habit tracker, a habit tracking tool for the user to put their resolutions and goals into practice, that is, to record actions and monitor progress of the new habits you want to put in your routine.

> The `assets` folder and the `notes.md and README.md` files located in the root folder of the application have no connection with the functioning of the project, they are contents only to establish this `README` and for personal use. You can delete it if you want.
